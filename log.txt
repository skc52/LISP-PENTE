To print the board...encountered so many errors, learned how to format the output
Took me hours to figure out out to perform recursion to create a board and print the board 
Discovered format function, newline character

Asked user for input..validated input..did coin toss..determined winner
Worked on setting a piece to desired row and col number

For validation input, could not validate if the row label is strictly numeric

Wrote function to determine row and col indices for the inputted position - parse-position

Wrote functions to get the color from row = i and col = j in the board 

added bounds checking in update board

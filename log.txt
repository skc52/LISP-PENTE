To print the board...encountered so many errors, learned how to format the output
Took me hours to figure out out to perform recursion to create a board and print the board 
Discovered format function, newline character

Asked user for input..validated input..did coin toss..determined winner
Worked on setting a piece to desired row and col number

For validation input, could not validate if the row label is strictly numeric

Wrote function to determine row and col indices for the inputted position - parse-position

Wrote functions to get the color from row = i and col = j in the board 

added bounds checking in update board


wrote function consecutive that return true/false based on the consecutive state and the number of consecutives 
that we wanna look for is provided in count parameter

added function to determine the total number of horizontal consecutives, vertical, backward digonal and forward diagonal
wrote function to give me the total number of 4 consecutives

explanation of the consecutive sum code

for horizontal, recursively check every row for horizontal and increase sum if found 
same for vertical, every col 

for backward diagonal, start from 15 row 1 column, go upto 0row 1 col 
then continue from 0 row 2 col upoto 0 row 16 col 

for forward diagonal, start from 15 fow 19 column, go upto 0 row 19 col,
then continue from 0 row 18 col upto 0 row 4 column

wrote functions to check for pairs, capture pairs, and get the capture count for a particular x and y, utilized gte-color function already
defined in board.lisp
